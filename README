## st - simple terminal

st is a simple terminal emulator for X which sucks less.

## Requirements

In order to build st you need the Xlib header files.

## Installation

Edit config.mk to match your local setup (st is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install st (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install

## Running st

If you did not install st with make clean install, you must compile
the st terminfo entry with the following command:

    tic -sx st.info

See the man page for additional details.

Don't forget to install the custom terminfo entry:

```
    sudo tic -sx st.info
```

Installation:

```
    make clean
    make
```

After this, if you have been making changes you can run the terminal to check their effect.

```
    st
```

And finally, installing the terminal:

````
    sudo make install
```
````
